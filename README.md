# BigDataProject
Upload Dataset => Code: Structure, Head, Tail & Summary => Data Cleaning => Transforme variables into numeric => Plot Graphs => Run Pearson and Spearman’s Correlation => Regression: Linear, KNN, and Regression Trees – Cross-Validations = > Evaluation: RMSE, AIC, and R Squared.

After uploading the dataset, we perform codes to see head, tail, structure, and summary to be aware of the different variables. We cleaned the data, deleting columns with no variables or no variance, converted variables to numeric variables. Ploted graphs: histograms, boxplot. 
We will run Pearson and Spearman’s correlations. As our database is numeric, we will use Regression and run the following algorithms: Linear Regression, KNN, and Regression Trees. We will run cross-validation for the above-noted algorithms.
We will work with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Root), AIC, and R Squared for evaluation.
